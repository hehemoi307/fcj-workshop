### Workshop Structure - The 5 Pillars of AWS Security

#### Pillar 1 - Identity & Access Management (8:50 - 9:30 AM)

##### Modern IAM Architecture
- **IAM Core Components**: Users, Roles, Policies for long-term credentials management
- **IAM Identity Center**: Single Sign-On (SSO) and permission sets
- **SCP & Permission Boundaries**: Multi-account security controls
- **MFA & Credential Rotation**: Enhanced authentication and Access Analyzer
- **Mini Demo**: Validate IAM Policy and simulate access scenarios

**Key Learning**: Transition from traditional user-based access to role-based, temporary credentials with centralized identity management.

#### Pillar 2 - Detection (9:30 - 9:55 AM)

##### Detection & Continuous Monitoring
- **CloudTrail**: Organization-level API logging and governance
- **GuardDuty**: Intelligent threat detection and Security Hub integration
- **VPC Flow Logs & ALB/S3 Logs**: Network traffic analysis and logging at scale
- **EventBridge**: Real-time alerting and automation workflows
- **Detection-as-Code**: Infrastructure-based detection rules and patterns

**Key Learning**: Implement layered detection strategy combining AWS native services with automated response capabilities.

#### Pillar 3 - Infrastructure Protection (10:10 - 10:40 AM)

##### Network & Workload Security
- **VPC Segmentation**: Private vs public subnet placement strategies
- **Security Groups vs NACLs**: Stateful vs stateless firewall configurations
- **WAF + Shield + Network Firewall**: Multi-layer DDoS and application protection
- **Workload Protection**: EC2, ECS/EKS security fundamentals and best practices

**Key Learning**: Design defense-in-depth network architecture with appropriate security controls at each layer.

#### Pillar 4 - Data Protection (10:40 - 11:10 AM)

##### Encryption, Keys & Secrets Management
- **KMS**: Comprehensive key policies, grants, and rotation strategies
- **Encryption Standards**: At-rest and in-transit encryption for S3, EBS, RDS, DynamoDB
- **Secrets Manager & Parameter Store**: Secure credential storage with patterns and rotation
- **Data Classification**: Implementing access controls and guardrails based on data sensitivity

**Key Learning**: Implement comprehensive encryption strategy with proper key management and secrets rotation.

#### Pillar 5 - Incident Response (11:10 - 11:40 AM)

##### IR Playbook & Automation
- **Incident Response Lifecycle**: Following AWS IR methodology and frameworks
- **Automated Response Playbooks**: Pre-defined response procedures for common scenarios
  - Compromised IAM key response procedures
  - S3 public exposure incident handling  
  - EC2 malware detection and isolation
- **Forensics Capabilities**: Snapshot, isolation, and evidence collection procedures
- **Auto-response Integration**: Lambda/Step Functions for immediate threat mitigation

**Key Learning**: Develop proactive incident response capabilities with automated remediation for faster threat containment.

### Key Highlights

#### Security-First Architecture Design
- **Shared Responsibility Model**: Clear understanding of AWS vs customer security responsibilities
- **Zero Trust Principles**: Never trust, always verify approach to cloud security
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers for comprehensive protection
- **Least Privilege Access**: Minimal necessary permissions with regular access reviews

#### Identity-Centric Security
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Moving beyond traditional user accounts
- **Temporary Credentials**: Short-lived tokens instead of long-term access keys  
- **Centralized Identity Management**: SSO integration with corporate directories
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Mandatory MFA for all administrative access

#### Proactive Threat Detection
- **Machine Learning-Based Detection**: GuardDuty's intelligent threat identification
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous security posture assessment
- **Automated Alerting**: Immediate notification of suspicious activities
- **Threat Intelligence Integration**: External threat feeds and indicators

#### Data-Centric Protection
- **Encryption Everywhere**: Default encryption for all data stores
- **Key Management**: Centralized, auditable key lifecycle management
- **Data Classification**: Appropriate protection based on data sensitivity
- **Access Controls**: Fine-grained permissions with regular auditing

#### Rapid Incident Response
- **Automated Remediation**: Immediate response to known threat patterns
- **Forensic Readiness**: Pre-positioned tools and procedures for investigation
- **Communication Plans**: Clear escalation and notification procedures
- **Continuous Improvement**: Post-incident analysis and playbook updates

### Key Takeaways
